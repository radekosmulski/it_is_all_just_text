# Understanding hypermedia

The inner-workings of the web are shrouded by layers and layers of abstractions. In your code, you manipulate objects such as `Customer` or `Item`, a high-level framework runs your code, displays something in the browser, and the state gets persisted to the db.

You might peel a layer or two, but most frameworks make it impossible to trace what's going on throughout the stack. As a junior dev, you practically stand no chance to see the web for what it really is.

And that is a damn shame. You are robbed of seeing the technology you work with in all its simplicity and beauty. You become intimidated by the unpierceable, opaque abstractions that surround you. Along the way, you lose your agency -- how can you change something you don't understand?

What is a cookie? What is a session? What is a request?

I remember the sense of awe and empowerment when I learned [it's all just text being sent back and forth](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1172).

In this repository, I bring the fabric of the web -- the HTTP protocol -- to light. I do so because it's fun, and I learn in the process.

But if you'd like to look beyond the impenetrable mirages of high-level frameworks to connect with the powerful ideas that made the web possible, here is your chance.

I am using LLMs to write and talk about the code in this repo, and I would suggest you do the same thing. If there is something you don't understand, ask an LLM for clarification.

## Awesome, overlooked resources

This repository was prompted by a fascinating conversation between Jeremy Howard and Carson Gross [about HTMX, but more broadly about all things web dev.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuipZMUch18).
